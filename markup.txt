TOPIC MARKUP SPECIFICATION



TAG: 1, SYNOPSIS


       This document  serves as  the canonical reference  describing the
       TOPIC markup [i] specification and is itself formatted as such.

       TOPIC markup provides a minimal  context for plain text databases
       that can be read/modified by most text editors, and easily parsed
       [ii] as well.

       Uses include: knowledge-bases, glossaries, apropos, notes...


TAG: 2, KEY CONCEPTS


       - Written and read as standard ASCII [iii].

       - Minimal markup grammar.

       - Associations linking blocks of data.

       - Self-indexing.

       - OS neutral.


TAG: 3, TAGS


       - Tag lines are always prefixed with the case insensitive
         reserved phrase 'TAG:' [iv].

         TAG: [x54, x41, x47, x3A]
         TAg: [x54, x41, x67, x3A]
         TaG: [x54, x61, x47, x3A]
         Tag: [x54, x61, x67, x3A]
         tAG: [x74, x41, x47, x3A]
         tAg: [x74, x41, x67, x3A]
         taG: [x74, x61, x47, x3A]
         tag: [x74, x61, x67, x3A]

       - A tag line is always located above the block it describes,
         alone on a single line.

       - Tags only contain alpha/numeric characters A-Z/a-z/0-9,
         and optionally spaces.

       - A tag can be either a single word, or a group of words.

       - Multiple tags are comma , [x2C] delimited.

       - A given tag can be used any number of times.


TAG: 4, BLOCKS


       - A block is always located below its tag line.

       - A block never contains the reserved phrase 'TAG:'
         (case insensitive) beginning at column 1.

       - Blocks may contain any number of lines.

       - Empty lines within a block are valid.


TAG: 5, LINES


       - Lines  are typically terminated  with a carriage  return [x0d],
         or line feed [x0a],  or CR/LF  pair.  Often, implementation  is
         operating system specific and conversion [v] may be required.

       - No limits are imposed on line length [vi].


TAG: 6, ASSOCIATIONS


       Using multiple tags can  establish associations between otherwise
       unrelated blocks. In  the example below, the 1st block  has a tag
       named 'Apples', the 2nd block has a tag named 'Oranges', and both
       blocks have a common tag named 'Fruit':


TAG: 7, Apples, Fruit


       Block line 1
       Block line 2
       Block line n...


TAG: 8, Oranges, Fruit


       Block line 1
       Block line 2
       Block line n...


       This means  you can stream the  1st block with the  'Apples' tag,
       stream  the 2nd  block with  the  'Oranges' tag,  or stream  both
       blocks via  the 'Fruit'  tag. The advantage  gained is  that your
       data can  be filtered in  an arbitrary manner. For  instance, you
       could have twelve  blocks, each with differing month  tags, and a
       common year tag allowing you to  scrutinize your data by month as
       well as year...


TAG: 9, PARSING


       - Per  query, a  file  is  read  in its  entirety,  line-by-line
         sequentially top to bottom, and each tag line left to right.

       - Only tags lines are  tested for equivalence against the current
         query, and if a match occurs,  then streams the block below up
         to the next tag line (if any).

       - For the sake of convenience, queries are case insensitive.


TAG: 10, GLOSSARY, i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi


       i.   Markup: A system for annotating text.

       ii.  Parse: To scan/analyze data looking for a desired pattern.

       iii. ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

       iv.  See topic 'HEX TABLE' for ASCII/hexadecimal equivalents.

       v.   Line ending conversion via sed:

            DOS to Unix: sed 's/^M$//' input.txt > output.txt
            Unix to DOS: sed 's/$/^M/' input.txt > output.txt

            Where '^M' [x0D] is an embedded control-M character.

       vi.  Caveat: The user should recognize the constraints governing
            the software rendering the data.
